Syrian Tarneeb is a card game that is played with a standard deck of 52 cards. The objective of the game is to be the first player to reach 41 points, with points being scored by winning tricks and declaring certain melds. Here is an algorithm for playing Syrian Tarneeb:

    The game begins with each player being dealt 13 cards. The player to the left of the dealer starts the bidding.
    
    During the bidding phase, players take turns declaring the number of tricks they think they can win in the round. The minimum bid is 7 tricks, and each subsequent bid must be higher than the previous one.
    
    Once all players have had a chance to bid, the player with the highest bid becomes the declarer and chooses the trump suit. The other players become the defenders.
    
    The declarer leads the first trick, and play continues clockwise. Each player must follow suit if they have a card of the same suit as the lead card. If they do not have a card of the same suit, they may play any card. The trick is won by the highest card of the suit led, or by the highest trump card if any were played.
    
    After all 13 tricks have been played, the declarer and the defenders count their points. The declarer scores points for each trick they won, as well as any melds they declared. The defenders score points for each trick they won, as well as any melds they declared.
    
    The game continues until one player reaches a score of 41 or more points. The player with the highest score at that point is the winner.
